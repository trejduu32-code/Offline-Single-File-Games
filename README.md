# A collection of offline single-file games.

A repo filled with more than a hundred offline games that can each run on a single file. This is a good option if you are having internet connectivity issues, or you're at some place with restricted internet.


No CDNs nor external frames, each game asset is inlined in the html file.


There's a single-file containing all the games but the games are located externally. It's recommended to store the game files in your downloads or Google Drive, then upload them to the single-file html (Supreme Math Lite)


The downside of inlining everything is the file size. Use chunks.py to split them. You can use https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/code-inputer2.html for loading the chunks.


The collection's updated regulary to add more offline games. Soon there will be 50+ more games...
